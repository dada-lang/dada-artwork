## Main logo and mascot: meet Tzara

**Tzara (they/them)** likes late-night coding sessions and code that is joyful, efficient, and reliable. They're also pretty into purple.

## Tzara likes to wear green

Sometimes Tzara likes to wear green.

## Alternate logo: Funky words

This alternate logo is appropriate if you want to look fancy. That's Tzara blinking out from the corner there (without their monocle).

## Origins etc

The name Tzara is in homage to the author of the Dada manifesto, [Tristan Tzara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Tzara).

The logo is meant to look similar to Duchamp's famous ["Bicycle Wheel" readymade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Wheel). Tzara's monocle is an homage to Rust's wonderful [bicycle gear logo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-artwork/blob/master/logo/rust-logo-blk.svg), as well.
