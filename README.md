Dada logo and other artwork:

## Main logo and mascot: meet Tzara

![Tzara in purple](./dada.svg)

As with rust-lang's [Ferris](https://rustacean.net/), Tzara's pronouns are "any": he/she/they/xir/it, it's all good. Tzara just likes to be talked about.

## Tzara likes to wear green

![Tzara in 'acid green'](./dada-acid-green.svg)

Sometimes Tzara likes to wear Green.

## Alternate logo: Funky words

![Word logo](./dada-letters.svg)

This alternate logo is appropriate if you want to look fancy. That's Tzara blinking out from the corner there (without their monocle).
