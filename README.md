## Main logo and mascot: meet Tzara

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dada-lang/dada-artwork/main/dada.svg"><img src="dada.svg" width="300" alt="Tzara"></img></a>

As with rust-lang's [Ferris](https://rustacean.net/), Tzara's pronouns are "any": he/she/they/xir/it, it's all good. Tzara just likes to be talked about.

## Tzara likes to wear green

Sometimes Tzara likes to wear Green.

## Alternate logo: Funky words

This alternate logo is appropriate if you want to look fancy. That's Tzara blinking out from the corner there (without their monocle).

## Origins etc

The name Tzara is in homage to the author of the Dada manifesto, [Tristan Tzara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Tzara).

The logo is meant to look similar to Duchamp's famous ["Bicycle Wheel" readymade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Wheel). Tzara's monocle is an homage to Rust's wonderful bicycle gear logo, as well.
